# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Project Summary

This project was to build a map showing earthquakes that have occurred in the past seven days using marker size and color to help distinguish magnitude.  Included on the map are the fault lines for the worldâ€™s tectonic plates.  There are three map display options and the ability to toggle on and off the earthquake markers layer and the tectonic plate layer.
The final version is in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.
